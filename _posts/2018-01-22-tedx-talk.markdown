Society often lauds the value of unique perspectives, but what should you do when your perspective doesnâ€™t gel
with those around you?

At age 11, I discovered that I have synesthesia, a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation
of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive
pathway. In the TEDx talk linked below, I told the story of my life with synesthesia and shared my thoughts about
how people who naturally interpret our world differently can sometimes possess valuable and unique abilities.

Huge thanks to my incredible TEDx mentor Syd Peterson, and to the TEDx Claremont Colleges team for
organizing and managing the event!
