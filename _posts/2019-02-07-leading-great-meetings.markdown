During my first year working as a Data Scientist, I bombed a presentation in front of my company's entire C-Suite.

I walked out of the meeting feeling crushed, and like I had just wasted everyone's time. But I was also surprised.
I had spent a week on the analysis, building the model and carefully vetting the results. How could things have gone
wrong with all of that effort? And then it hit me.

>Leading up to that presentation, I spent 95% of my time on the technical work, and the remaining 5% on hastily pasting
the outputs of my model into a slide deck. **Virtually all of my preparation was spent on the data, and almost none
of it on the people who would be in the meeting to discuss it.** No wonder things had gone wrong!

There is reason for the hype surrounding "data-driven decisions" in industry; data is powerful stuff. But data can't
work its magic unless it is communicated effectively to its audience. In this post I outline 6 tips for
leading clear, effective meetings where data is being presented, to make sure that your data is making the incredible
impact that it can.


## 1) Lead with the "why."
Your analysis is awesome, and you want to dive right in. As tempting as it is to lead with the cool insights that
you've uncovered, lead instead with the *reason* for holding the meeting.

>Get people engaged right out of the gate with a clear, human-readable explanation of why everyone is in the meeting
together, and set the goals for what your team should accomplish during the time. **As heavy-handed as it sounds,
defining a “goal” in a text box somewhere on the introductory slide is often instrumental in setting up successful
meetings.**

So why lead with the "why?" Imagine you've been meeting-hopping all day, and your calendar pings you with a
reminder for a meeting in 5 minutes. Wait, what was that meeting about again? Chances are you haven't read the
meeting description since you accepted the invite a week ago. Maybe you didn't even read it then. In these cases,
it's incredibly helpful to have someone set a clear definition of the purpose and objectives right at the start, and get
everyone aligned on the meeting goal.


## 2) State assumptions and disclaimers *before* showing any analysis.
One thing I learned the hard way is that the moment that you put a graph or a table of results in front of your
audience, you irreversibly lose a significant portion of their attention to that visual stimuli. So it follows
that if you're explaining important caveats and assumptions implicit in your data, people may not hear
you if they have a beautiful graph or table to steal their attention away.

>And this is where things get dangerous. Every analysis comes with warnings and disclaimers about how to interpret,
and how NOT to interpret, the results. **If the warnings aren't clear, folks can (and will) leave the meeting with
faulty conclusions.**

It's incredibly important to present this information in a way that maximizes the chances that people hear it. For this
reason I recommend **dedicating an entire slide to detailing the warnings and assumptions implicit in the analysis,
without anything else that might distract from it.**


## 3) Graphs are great! Except when they're not.
We’ve all had those imposter-syndrome moments during meetings where we sat
staring at a complicated architecture diagram, or someone’s modeling results, thinking “I don’t get this… man, do I
feel dumb right now." This holds especially true for senior folks, who naturally feel more
pressure to be a voice of leadership in the room.

>Meetings tend to go off the rails quickly when someone feels defensive, and **there is no quicker way to feel defensive
than not understanding a graph or a result.**

To avoid this, practice empathy for your future audience when building your slides. For every graphic or result that you
include, review it and re-review it through the lens of “what would someone with no background in this data need to
understand this?” Are the axis labels clear? Is the graph easily interpretable? Is a moving average graph with no
explanation of its physical meaning really fair to this audience?

Even better is to phone a friend! For important presentations, I strongly recommend asking a colleague who isn't
familiar with the underlying data to review your slides ahead of time. Do they understand what you're hoping to
communicate?


## 4) Having said that... don’t mistake verbosity for clarity.
While we want the context and methodology to be clear to our audience, it's important not to stray into
"drowning in details" territory. Often what’s needed to grasp an analysis is a succinct, high-level description;
overly detailed descriptions of the precise math behind the model often distract from the meaning of the results,
and will quickly lose your audience.

>Focus instead on the **"need"** part of the previous question of
“what would someone with no background in this data need to understand these results?”


## 5) Spend at least *some* time on slide design.
As a woman working in a male-dominated industry, I always feel self-conscious when I'm tweaking the color
scheme on a slide instead of writing code. **I'm nevertheless convinced that people are more engaged in meetings
where they like looking at the material being projected.** And engagement is paramount to a productive meeting.

>This isn't to say that you need to go crazy aligning every detail on the slides, or picking the perfect font style.
But **if your slides are more visually appealing than your audience's email inboxes, chances are that's where they'll
keep their attention.**


## 6) Phrase your follow-ups.
You just presented a clear and compelling analysis, and your audience is bought-in and excited. Nice work!

This is the time when requests for follow-up work will likely pop up. In the moment, it's easy to get caught up
and agree to a ton of new work, especially with the excited energy in the room. This topic could easily warrant its
own post, but for now, I offer the following tips:

**1. Avoid language that means different things to different people.**
My favorite example is the word "easy." Technical folks typically use the word "easy" to mean "oh yeah, that is a thing
that is physically possible for us to do." Non-technical folks often use "easy" to mean "we can do that quickly." See
the danger here? From personal experience, I can attest that friction arises when an engineer describes a mundane, but
very time consuming, ask as "easy" only to have a business-side consumer assume that means the task will be quick. You
can imagine the frustration when the two parties realize the miscommunication.

**2. Proactively and gracefully manage scope creep.**
Saying "no" to an ask for follow-up work is as much art as it is skill. We want to help our colleagues out, and saying
"no" can easily feel like the antithesis of being a team player. But as many wise people have pointed out, saying "yes"
to one task means saying "no" to another. If the follow-up work is out of scope, or will delay work that is higher
priority for your company, resist the strong temptation to immediately agree to it. If your company culture allows it,
diplomatically reject the follow-up ask, while explaining your competing priorities. If however you work on a team where
saying "no" in a public setting is not the norm, I recommend setting up a private follow-up meeting to discuss the
work being proposed, and what priorities might out-compete it.


## And that's it!
The short version of the points above is to design meetings and presentations with empathy for your target audiences.
If you put yourself in their shoes, and aim to build material that is clear and easy to engage with, the results
will follow.

May the force be with you, and the next amazing meeting that you lead!
