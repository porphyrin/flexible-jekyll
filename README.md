# Welcome to my personal project page!
This project site showcases technical projects that I've worked on in my spare time, and includes blog posts about 
learnings from industry.

Many thanks and (and due credit) to artemsheludko for the [forked Jekyll template.](
https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll/)

# First Time Set-Up
1. As this site is built from a Jekyll template, we'll need to first install the Jekyll (a Ruby Gem). The requirements
for this gem can be [found here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) - check these first!
2.  macOS installation instructions can be [found here.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) If preferred,
you can also install Ruby via the RVM instructions [found here](https://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2010/9/23/install-rails-ruby-mac)
3. Run the `jekyll serve` command to develop and test updates to the site locally.
